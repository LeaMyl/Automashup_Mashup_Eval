Track Selection : Choosing specific parts (e.g., vocals, instrumentals) of the songs to be used in the mashup. Mashup Techniques : Implementing algorithms to synchronize beats, adjust tempo and pitch, and align musical phases between the selected tracks using libraries like pyrubberband and pyloudnorm. Output : Generating the final mashup audio file. Key Features: Automated analysis and preprocessing of musical tracks. Flexible selection of song components for mashup creation. Multiple mashup techniques for beat synchronization, pitch adjustment, and phase alignment. Easy-to-use interface for experimentation and customization. How does it work? Given several songs, our app uses state-of-the-art tools to separate the sources of the songs and then reunite them to create a new song. You can check our Jupyter Notebook here.","title":"How It Works"},{"location":"explanation/#automashup","text":"The process involves: Preprocessing : Extracting key features from input songs, such as beats, downbeats, segments, and key signatures using the allin1 library.
